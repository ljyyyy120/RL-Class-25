    Compute discounted returns (cumulative future rewards) for each timestep.

    This can be computed recursively (starting from the end of the trajectory):

    Compute Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE).

    GAE provides a way to estimate advantages that balances bias and variance.
    It uses a weighted average of n-step advantage estimates.

        A_t = delta_t + (gamma * lambda) * delta_{t+1} + (gamma * lambda)^2 * delta_{t+2} + ...

    2. Extract the probability of the action that was actually taken
    3. Return the log of that probability (for numerical stability)

    Sample continuous actions with tanh squashing and compute log probabilities.

    For continuous control, we sample from a Gaussian and then apply tanh to
    bound actions to [-1, 1]. This is called the "squashed Gaussian" policy.

    The sampling process:
        1. Sample z ~ N(mean, std)           # Unbounded Gaussian sample
        2. action = tanh(z)                   # Squash to [-1, 1]

    The log probability requires a Jacobian correction for the tanh transform.
    When you apply a deterministic transformation a = tanh(z) to a random variable z,
    the probability density changes according to the change-of-variables formula:

        p(a) = p(z) * |dz/da|

    Since da/dz = 1 - tanh(z)^2 = 1 - a^2, we have |dz/da| = 1 / (1 - a^2).
    Taking the log and summing over action dimensions:

        log p(a) = log p(z) - sum(log(1 - a^2))

    Intuitively, tanh "compresses" the tails of the Gaussian — many different z values
    near +/-inf all map to actions near +/-1. The Jacobian correction accounts for this
    compression: actions near the boundaries are more likely than the raw Gaussian
    density would suggest, because a wide range of z values map there.

    Why tanh squashing?
    - Many environments expect actions in some bounded range.
    - Clipping actions without correcting for the changed probabilities leads to
      an incorrect likelihood, which breaks policy gradient methods.

        probs: Tensor of shape (batch_size, num_actions) containing action probabilities
               (i.e., after softmax). Unlike discrete_entropy which takes raw logits and
               applies softmax internally, this function expects pre-normalized probabilities
               that sum to 1 along the last dimension.

    Returns:
        entropy: Scalar tensor containing mean entropy across the batch

    Nuances to handle:
        - Add epsilon (1e-8) before taking log to handle the case where a probability
          is exactly 0. Without this, log(0) = -inf and you'll get NaN.
        - Return the mean entropy across the batch, not the sum.

# Part 4: Rollout Buffer for Vectorized Environments
# =============================================================================


class RolloutBuffer:
    """
    Buffer for storing trajectories collected from vectorized environments.

    In PPO, we collect a fixed number of steps from multiple parallel environments,
    then use all that data to update the policy. This buffer stores:
    - Observations (states)
    - Actions taken
    - Log probabilities of actions (under the old policy, for computing ratio)
    - Rewards received
    - Done flags (episode boundaries)
    - Value estimates (for computing advantages)

    Key concept: partial episodes
    When we collect num_steps from each environment, episodes may not be complete.
    For incomplete episodes, we need to "bootstrap" the value of the final state
    to estimate the return. This is handled in compute_returns_and_advantages.
    See the README for more details

    Example with num_steps=4 and num_envs=2:
        Env 0: [s0, s1, s2, s3] -> episode continues (need bootstrap)
        Env 1: [s0, s1, DONE, s0, s1] -> episode ended, new one started

    A useful thing to note: returns = advantages + values
